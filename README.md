# üöÄ Umeed: AI-Powered Healthcare Assistant
> Revolutionizing healthcare with AI assistance and connecting blood donors with those in need.
---
## üìå Problem Statement
**Problem Statement 1 ‚Äì Weave AI magic with Groq**
---
## üéØ Objective
Umeed addresses critical gaps in healthcare accessibility and emergency medical response through two integrated solutions:

1. **AI-powered medical assistance** for those without immediate access to healthcare professionals, providing reliable information and document interpretation.

2. **Emergency blood donation coordination** that connects donors with recipients during critical situations through a hierarchical location-based matching system.

This serves both rural and urban populations facing healthcare barriers, particularly in medical emergencies where timely blood donation can be life-saving.

## üß† Team & Approach
### Team Name:  
`Small Brains`
### Team Members:  
- [Soham Sadhukhan](https://github.com/soham247) 
- [Raj Dutta](https://github.com/Dutta2005) 
- [Soumodwip Mondal](https://github.com/Soumodwip-Mondal) 
- [Suman Paul](https://github.com/SUMAn9682) 

### Your Approach:  
- We chose this problem after witnessing the challenges faced by a team member's relative in finding blood donors during an emergency.
- Key challenges included creating a reliable medical AI assistant that provides accurate information while clearly indicating its limitations and keeping the context of previous conversations and also keeping the conversation history, and developing a real-time notification system that prioritizes geographical proximity.
- Our breakthrough came when we integrated Groq's API for medical information processing, significantly improving response quality and speed compared to our initial prototype.
